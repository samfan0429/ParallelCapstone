                <p>For the Macalester summer research of 2020, I worked on the parallelization of a computational 
                    program relevant to viscous fluid mechanics provided by Professor William Mitchell.
                    <br> <br>
                    There  were  two  versions  of  the  code;  the  simpler  one  is  called  "Slender-Body  Theory" and a more complicated one is called the "full-PDE."
                    The most time-costly part of both computations was the numerical evaluation of many integrals (one-dimensional integrals for Slender-Body Theory, and improper surface integrals for the full PDE). 
                    Both versions were implemented using multidimensional array operations in NumPy. 
                    My attempts were to parallelize the Slender-Body Theory computation by flattening the arrays and using "scatter-gather" operations or simple message-passing with the MPI4PY package in Python.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to time limit of the project, the analysis of the program's parallelism was done on 
                    the simple message-passing with the newest version of "full-PDE," main program to be parallelized in the project.
                    <br><br>
                    In the instruction section, I explain about the background and capabilities of MPI and MPI4PY package.
                    The work section explores the details of MPI4PY and the specific algorithm with pseudocode that
                    explains of what happened in specific with variables. At the end of the work section, I give a brief
                    analysis on the results of parallelization and its speed-ups. The future work is a brief page that
                    explains on the future of parallelization with this program.
